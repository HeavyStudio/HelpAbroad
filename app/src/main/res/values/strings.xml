    <string name="rationale_location">Granting location access allows Help Abroad to identify the
        country you are in for relevant emergency numbers and helps services find you faster in an
        emergency. Your location is only used when you actively use the app for these purposes.</string>

    <string name="rationale_call_phone">This permission is needed so you can tap a number within
        Help Abroad and immediately initiate a call to emergency services without leaving the app.
        We will never make calls without your direct action.</string>

        official emergency numbers that support text messaging. This can be vital if a voice call
        isn\'t possible or suitable for you. Messages are only sent when you choose to use this
        specific feature to contact these services.</string>
