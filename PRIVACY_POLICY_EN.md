# Privacy Policy for Help Abroad

**Effective Date:** October 8, 2025

Heavy Studio ("us", "we", or "our") built the Help Abroad app (the "Application") as a utility app.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Application.

## Information Collection and Use

The Help Abroad application **does not collect any personally identifiable information** from its users. All data used by the application (emergency numbers, country names) is either embedded within the application itself or stored locally on your device. No information is transmitted to us or any third parties.

## App Permissions

The application may request the `CALL_PHONE` permission for a single purpose:

* **To make a direct call:** This permission is only used if you enable the "Direct Call" feature in the settings and explicitly click on an emergency number. The application never makes calls without a direct action from you. We do not access or store your call logs or contacts.

## Log Data

In case of an error in the app, third-party services (such as Google Play) may collect anonymous data on your device called Log Data. This data may include information such as your device's IP address, device name, operating system version, the time and date of the error, and other statistics. This information is used solely for diagnosing and fixing technical problems.

## Links to Other Sites

The application may contain links to other sites (for example, to the Play Store listing for rating). Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the privacy policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
